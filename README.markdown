A compiler for a kernel of Scheme.

Currently compiles a subset supporting

 - Basic arithmetic
 - Symbols
 - First class continuations
 - Tail calls
 - Closures
 - Mutation (which works with closures)

The runtime system currently is the simplest possible implementation.
This will support garbage collection Real Soon Now.
